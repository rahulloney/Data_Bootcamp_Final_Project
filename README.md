**Project Description**

Exploring Loan Defaults on Lending Club:
The project deals with identifying factors that play a part in an individual defaulting on his loan payment when he borrows from the Lending Club platform. A thorough initial exploration through data manipulation and visualization is aimed at isolating features of the dataset that seem to have an impact on the number of Defaults. With this knowledge, statisctical methods of logisitic regression is used to quantify the causal impact along with an analysis of each regression coefficient. Finally, random forest and decision tree machine learning model are used to predict a bad (defaulted) loan, given features of the dataset.
